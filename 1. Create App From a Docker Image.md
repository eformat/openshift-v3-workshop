#**Lab 1: Creating and Application from a Docker Image**

In this lab you will learn to create a new project and create an application from an existing docker image.

**Step 1: Add a new project from command line** 

**Note:** Please replace UserName with the username assigned to you in the commands below.

    $ oc new-project mycliproject-username --description="My CLI Project" --display-name="CLI Project"

Upon project creation, OpenShift will automatically switch to the newly created project/namespace. If you wish to view the list of projects, run the following command:

    $ oc get projects

If you have more than one project, you can switch to a different one by issuing `oc project <project name>`. Although you don't want to do it now.

You can also check the status of the project by running the following command. It says that the project is currently not running anything.

    $ oc status
    In project CLI Project (mycliproject-username)

    In project CLI Project (wk1) on server https://ose31-master.hosts.foo.com:8443

    You have no services, deployment configs, or build configs.
    Run 'oc new-app' to create an application.

**Step 2: Create an application from a Docker Image**

Next we will create an application inside the above project using an existing docker image. We will be using a very simple docker image on dockerhub that just says "Welcome to OpenShift V3". Let us just use that for this exercise.

First create a new application using the dockerimage using the `oc new-app` command as shown below:

    $ oc new-app eformat/welcome
    --> Found Docker image eab4dc3 (20 minutes old) from Docker Hub for "eformat/welcome"
        * An image stream will be created as "welcome:latest" that will track this image
        * This image will be deployed in deployment config "welcome"
        * The image does not expose any ports - if you want to load balance or send traffic to this component
          you will need to create a service with 'expose dc/welcome --port=[port]' later
    --> Creating resources with label app=welcome ...
        ImageStream "welcome" created
        DeploymentConfig "welcome" created
    --> Success
        Run 'oc status' to view your app.

Note: the source for creating the welcome image is [here](https://github.com/eformat/welcome) and is a simple
shell script layered ontop of a busybox image

The above command uses the docker image to deploy a docker container in a pod. If you quickly run `oc get pods` you will notice that a deployer pod runs and it starts an application pod as shown below.

    $ oc get pods
    NAME               READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    welcome-1-041z2    0/1       Pending   0          6s
    welcome-1-deploy   1/1       Running   0          9s

In the above example `welcome-1-deploy` is the deployer pod and the other one is the actual application pod. In a little while the deployer pod will succeed and the application pod will change for `Pending` to `Running` status.

    $ oc get pods
    NAME              READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    welcome-1-041z2   1/1       Running   0          1m

**Step 3: Add a Route for your application**

OpenShift also spins up a service for this application. Run the following command to view the list of services in the project.

    $ oc get svc
    NAME      CLUSTER_IP       EXTERNAL_IP   PORT(S)   SELECTOR                               AGE
    welcome   172.30.****216   <none>        80/TCP    app=welcome,deploymentconfig=welcome   1m

You will notice the `welcome` service was created for this project.

However, there is no route for this application yet. So you cannot access this application from outside yet.

Now add a route to the service with the following command. `oc expose` command will allow you to expose your service to the world so that you can access it from the browser. 

**Note**: I am using a domain name of `apps.osecloud.com`. Ask the instructor on the domain name suffix for your setup an change it. 

    $ oc expose service welcome --name=welcome --hostname=welcome.username.apps.osecloud.com
    NAME      HOST/PORT                     PATH      SERVICE   LABELS
    welcome   welcome.username.apps.osecloud.com             welcome

**Step 4: Try your application**

Access the application: Now access the application using curl or from the browser and see the result

    $ curl http://welcome.username.apps.osecloud.com
    Hello ! Welcome to OpenShift 3

Voila!! you created your first application using an existing docker image on OpenShift. 

**Step 4: Clean up**

Run the `oc get all` command to view all the components that were created in your project.


    $ oc get all

    welcome           welcome.apps.foo.com                                                                                                  welcome                                                     app=welcome
    NAME              CLUSTER_IP                  EXTERNAL_IP                                                                               PORT(S)                                                     SELECTOR                               AGE
    welcome           172.30.89.70                <none>                                                                                    8080/TCP                                                    app=welcome,deploymentconfig=welcome   36m
    NAME              READY                       STATUS                                                                                    RESTARTS                                                    AGE
    welcome-1-e5lto   1/1                         Running                                                                                   0                                                           34m

Now you can delete all these components by running one command.

    $ oc delete all --all
    imagestream "welcome" deleted
    deploymentconfig "welcome" deleted
    route "welcome" deleted
    service "welcome" deleted
    pod "welcome-1-e5lto" deleted

You will notice that it has deleted the imagestream for the application, the deploymentconfig, the service and the route.
 
You can run `oc get all` again to make sure the project is empty.

**Congratulations!!** You now know how to create a project, an application using an external docker image and navigate around. Get ready for more fun stuff!
