#**Lab 12: Code promotion across environments**

In this lab we will learn how an application binary can be promoted across the environments. As as example we will use development
and QA environments as promotion to Pre-prod and Production will be very similar.

In this example we are using projects as means of separation of environments (development, qa, production).

A more complex setup may use independent OpenShift environments for dev/test/qa and production and would involve exposing the OpenShift
docker registry between environments.


**Step 1: Create two projects**

Create two projects. Name them "development-username" and "testing-username".

**Remember** to substitute the username.

    $ oc new-project development-username --description="development-username" --display-name="development-username"
    $ oc new-project testing-username --description="testing-username" --display-name="testing-username"


**Step 2: Provide ImagePuller Access to the QA Project from Development Project**

The following command will allow the QA project to be able to pull the docker images from the Development project.

Run this from your "testing-username" project.

    $ oc policy add-role-to-group system:image-puller system:serviceaccounts:testing-username -n development-username


**Step 3: Create an application in the development project**

Switch over to the "development-username" project and deploy an application using eap6-basic-sti template.

You can use webconsole or command line. The command line option is shown below.

**Bonus points:** Clone this application to your own github account and deploy it so that you can redeploy with changes later.

**Remeber to replace with your username**

    $ oc project development-username
    $ oc new-app --template=eap64-basic-s2i -p APPLICATION_NAME=myapp,HOSTNAME_HTTP=myapp-dev-username.apps.foo.com,SOURCE_REPOSITORY_URL=https://github.com/eformat/kitchensink,SOURCE_REPOSITORY_REF="",CONTEXT_DIR="" -l name=myapp-dev

    --> Deploying template eap64-basic-s2i in project openshift for "eap64-basic-s2i"
         With parameters:
          APPLICATION_NAME=myapp
          APPLICATION_DOMAIN=myapp-dev.apps.foo.com
          SOURCE_REPOSITORY_URL=https://github.com/eformat/kitchensink
          SOURCE_REPOSITORY_REF=
          CONTEXT_DIR=
          HORNETQ_QUEUES=
          HORNETQ_TOPICS=
          HORNETQ_CLUSTER_PASSWORD=uSLYHjpC # generated
          GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET=IiNUDqQy # generated
          GENERIC_WEBHOOK_SECRET=2OTbIqd2 # generated
          IMAGE_STREAM_NAMESPACE=openshift
    --> Creating resources with label name=myapp-dev ...
        Service "myapp" created
        Route "myapp" created
        ImageStream "myapp" created
        BuildConfig "myapp" created
        DeploymentConfig "myapp" created
    --> Success
        Build scheduled for "myapp" - use the logs command to track its progress.
        Run 'oc status' to view your app.

It is worth noting that we used the Template (and not the image) for building the kitchensikn example (See Lab 4). Using the Template
ensures a route is built, it also has the added advantage of allowing us to customise various names and services as part of the build.


**Step 4: Tag the docker image**

Wait until the application gets built and deployed. Now if you check the imagestreams you will find the docker image for this application.

Now find the imagestream name using the following command. "is" is the short form for imagestream.

    $ oc get is
    NAME      DOCKER REPO                                      TAGS      UPDATED
    myapp     172.30.234.236:5000/development-username/myapp   latest    4 minutes ago

Now describe this image stream to get the full image id

    $ oc describe is myapp
    Name:			myapp
    Created:		9 minutes ago
    Labels:			application=myapp,name=myapp-dev,template=eap64-basic-s2i,xpaas=1.1.0
    Annotations:		openshift.io/generated-by=OpenShiftNewApp
    			openshift.io/image.dockerRepositoryCheck=2015-11-19T03:44:21Z
    Docker Pull Spec:	172.30.234.236:5000/development-username/myapp

    Tag	Spec		Created		PullSpec														Image
    latest	<pushed>	5 minutes ago	172.30.234.236:5000/development-username/myapp@sha256:9502d5952821b5940f7a2ab72fe5401d52c704daf3ebb0b8ceae0a15848c36c0


In my case `development-username/myapp@sha256:9502d5952821b5940f7a2ab72fe5401d52c704daf3ebb0b8ceae0a15848c36c0` is the full image id.

Note: Leave the repository off the Image name if present e.g. `172.30.234.236:5000/`

Now let us assume that this docker image is good and is ready to promote to QA. Let us tag this docker image using the `oc tag` command.

The format is:

    $ oc tag FullImageId development-username/myapp:promote-qa

In my case it is:

    $ oc tag development-username/myapp@sha256:9502d5952821b5940f7a2ab72fe5401d52c704daf3ebb0b8ceae0a15848c36c0 development-username/myapp:promote-qa

You can verify the tag by:

    $ oc describe is myapp
    Name:			myapp
    Created:		24 minutes ago
    Labels:			application=myapp,name=myapp-dev,template=eap64-basic-s2i,xpaas=1.1.0
    Annotations:		openshift.io/generated-by=OpenShiftNewApp
    			openshift.io/image.dockerRepositoryCheck=2015-11-19T03:44:21Z
    Docker Pull Spec:	172.30.234.236:5000/development-username/myapp

    Tag		Spec		Created		PullSpec														Image
    latest		<pushed>	20 minutes ago	172.30.234.236:5000/development-username/myapp@sha256:9502d5952821b5940f7a2ab72fe5401d52c704daf3ebb0b8ceae0a15848c36c0
    promote-qa	<pushed>	5 minutes ago	172.30.234.236:5000/development-username/myapp@sha256:9502d5952821b5940f7a2ab72fe5401d52c704daf3ebb0b8ceae0a15848c36c0


**Step 5: Deploy the application to QA**

Now you can switch over to the QA project and deploy the docker image that we tagged in development. Also expose service to create route for this project.
**Remember** to substitute username

    $ oc project testing-username
    Now using project "testing-username" on server "https://ose31-master.hosts.foo.com:8443".

    $ oc new-app development-username/myapp:promote-qa
    --> Found image c93e5f9 (21 minutes old) in image stream "myapp in project development-username" under tag :promote-qa for "development-username/myapp:promote-qa"
        * This image will be deployed in deployment config "myapp"
        * Ports 8080/tcp, 8443/tcp will be load balanced by service "myapp"
    --> Creating resources with label app=myapp ...
        DeploymentConfig "myapp" created
        Service "myapp" created
    --> Success
        Run 'oc status' to view your app.

    $ oc expose service myapp
    route "myapp" exposed


Test this application in the QA project. Note that we deployed the docker image from the development project without rebuilding the code

**Bonus points**: Make changes to your git repo ( to src/main/webapp/index.xhtml) and deploy it to development first.

Notice that your changes are seen only in development project. Repeat the changes a couple of times. Now find the latest imagestream and tag it as promote-qa.

Watch out that the QA project gets redeployed when you update the new tag.

Watch this [video](https://blog.openshift.com/promoting-applications-across-environments) for complete understanding. 

**Congratulations!** you now know how to promote your application across environments in OpenShift 3.
